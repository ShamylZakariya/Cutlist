Next Steps:

- It may be impractical for now to solve the way I do with permutations/shuffling. Instead, consider an input file that says:
    - boards:
        - 96x8
        - 96x6
        etc
    This says, "I can source any number of boards of these dimensions. The solver then tries to find the optimal layout


- Need to respect requested spacing
- Need to add visualization
